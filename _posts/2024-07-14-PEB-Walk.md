title: "Part 1: PEB Walk and API hashing for Malware Analysis"
tags:

Hello world! It's July and this is another blog post on malware analysis. I came across with an idea to write this blog since I felt like beginner in the Malware analysis field should understand this topic thoroughly as this technique commonly used by the modern malwares.

The reason of the malware author implements this technique are fairly simple. First, to avoid straightforward inspection of API function calls in the Import Address Table (IAT) by analysts which makes it harder for analysts to identify and guess the malware's behavior based on the imports functions. Second, to makes the sample difficult for analysts to quickly identify which API functions it is calling while reversing the malware sample. Third, shellcode often used this PEB walk to reconstruct import table and then resolve Windows API.

Before we jump too deep. This is long short story what it does:
1. PEB walks are commonly used to locate modules (typically DLLs like `ntdll.dll` or `kernel32.dll`) within the currently running process.
2. API hashing are uses to dynamically resolve ("recover") WinAPI calls by comparing pre-computed hashes with the hashes of APIs during runtime.

As a result, during your static analysis of the IAT, WinAPI calls and DLL filenames aren't directly visible. Meaning you have no clue what the sample does based on the WinAPI calls and DLL filenames provided.

We're going to cover PEB walk in this first part of the blog series instead of explaining both PEB walks and API hashing, to avoid a longer blog post.

# What is PEB
When a process running, Windows OS will allocates a Process Environment Block (PEB) structure for the process. The PEB is created by the kernel and it basically contains fields that provide information such as loaded modules, process parameters, environment variables, and many more.

Below is the PEB structure from MSDN (not fully documented) contains all parameters associated by system with current process:
```
typedef struct _PEB {
  BYTE                          Reserved1[2];
  BYTE                          BeingDebugged; // Commonly used in malware for anti-debug mechanism. IsDebuggerPresent() used this param to check for debugger.
  BYTE                          Reserved2[1];
  PVOID                         Reserved3[2];
  PPEB_LDR_DATA                 Ldr; // A pointer to a PEB_LDR_DATA structure that contains information about the loaded modules for the process.
  PRTL_USER_PROCESS_PARAMETERS  ProcessParameters;
  PVOID                         Reserved4[3];
  PVOID                         AtlThunkSListPtr;
  PVOID                         Reserved5;
  ULONG                         Reserved6;
  PVOID                         Reserved7;
  ULONG                         Reserved8;
  ULONG                         AtlThunkSListPtr32;
  PVOID                         Reserved9[45];
  BYTE                          Reserved10[96];
  PPS_POST_PROCESS_INIT_ROUTINE PostProcessInitRoutine;
  BYTE                          Reserved11[128];
  PVOID                         Reserved12[1];
  ULONG                         SessionId;
} PEB, *PPEB;
```

From the above structure members, we can see `Ldr` member. This member contains a pointer to a `PEB_LDR_DATA`  structure containing information about all of the loaded modules (EXE/DLLs) in the current process and to the doubly-linked list (`InMemoryOrderModuleList`). This linked list will be use to find the addresses of loaded DLLâ€™s.

```
typedef struct _PEB_LDR_DATA {
  ULONG                   Length;
  BOOLEAN                 Initialized;
  PVOID                   SsHandle;
  LIST_ENTRY              InLoadOrderModuleList;
  LIST_ENTRY              InMemoryOrderModuleList;
  LIST_ENTRY              InInitializationOrderModuleList;
} PEB_LDR_DATA, *PPEB_LDR_DATA;
```

In this structure, a process (malware) would used `InMemoryOrderModuleList` to enumerate loaded modules. This linked list contains entries for each module, represented by `LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY` structures, which provide detailed information about each module.

```
typedef struct _LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY {
  PVOID Reserved1[2];
  LIST_ENTRY InMemoryOrderLinks;
  PVOID Reserved2[2];
  PVOID DllBase; // Base address of the DLL
  PVOID EntryPoint;
  ULONG SizeOfImage;
  UNICODE_STRING FullDllName; // Full path to the DLL
  UNICODE_STRING BaseDllName; // Base name of the DLL
  ULONG Flags;
  USHORT LoadCount;
  USHORT TlsIndex;
  LIST_ENTRY HashLinks;
  ULONG TimeDateStamp;
  PVOID EntryPointActivationContext;
  PVOID PatchInformation;
  LIST_ENTRY ForwarderLinks;
  LIST_ENTRY ServiceTagLinks;
  LIST_ENTRY StaticLinks;
  PVOID ContextInformation;
  ULONG OriginalBase;
  LARGE_INTEGER LoadTime;
} LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY, *PLDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY;
```

If you use `WinDbg` and type `!peb`, the `Ldr.InMemoryOrderModuleList` field will show you the list of DLLs loaded for the current process (Notepad).

# Accessing PEB structure in code
So, how can malware access this structure? There are few common methods to access the PEB structure in malware code:

### 1. Direct access via fs:[0x30] using assembly
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <Windows.h>

int main() {
    PVOID peb;

    __asm {
        mov eax, fs:[0x30]
        mov peb, eax
    }

    printf("PEB Address: %p\n", peb);
    return 0;
}
```

In the above code, the code uses `__asm` keyword to insert assembly instructions directly. In that particular code block, it access TEB via the `fs` segment register. `fs` is a segment register used in 32-bit Windows to point to the TEB. In this case, `fs:[0x30]` is the offset within the TEB that contains a pointer to the PEB.

If we compiled the code above, and reverse the code in IDA, we'll see IDA decompiler represent the `fs:[0x30]` as `NtCurrentPeb()` and `dword ptr [ebp+var_C]`  in the `IDA View-A` represent variable `peb` in the original code.

### 2. Using Undocumented APIs, NtCurrentPeb()
In this code, we directly uses an undocumented function that returns the PEB address instead of using Inline assembly.
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <Windows.h>

extern "C" __declspec(dllimport) PVOID NTAPI NtCurrentPeb();

int main() {
    PVOID peb = NtCurrentPeb();

    printf("PEB Address: %p\n", peb);

    return 0;
}
```

The result of the code in IDA decompiler is the same as the first one the only different that you'll see the program will try to call function `GetCurrentThreadId()` before run the `NtCurrentPeb()`.

# PEB Walk
In malware context, the PEB contains the information about loaded modules (malware's interests: `kernel32.dll` and ntdll.dll) that have been mapped into process space which can be use this information to dynamically resolve function in the particular DLL. By walking through the PEB structure, malware can extract the base addresses of these DLLs and then resolve the addresses of specific functions within these DLLs.

For example, `kernel32.dll` contains two important functions that malware often seeks:
- `LoadLibraryA(libraryname)`: Loads the specified DLL into the process.
- `GetProcAddress(hmodule, functionname)`: Retrieves the address of an exported function or variable from the specified DLL.

In above example, the goal of the PEB walk in malware is straightforward, which is to identify the address of the `LoadLibraryA` function inside `kernel32.dll` and use it to load a library and its functions dynamically.

To simply put the flow, here are the 'process' of the PEB walk for `kernel32.dll` and resolve addresses of `LoadLibraryA` and `GetProcAddress` then use it to invoke `MessageBoxA`.

1. Obtains and access the PEB structure of the current process
2. Navigate to the `PEB_LDR_DATA` Structure Using the `Ldr` member of the `PEB`
3. Iterate through the `InLoadOrderModuleList` to find the `LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY` for `kernel32.dll`
4. Once the entry for `kernel32.dll` is found, extract its base address
5. Using the base address, resolve the addresses of `LoadLibraryA` and `GetProcAddress`
6. Load `user32.dll` using `LoadLibraryA`
7. Get the address of `MessageBoxA` from `user32.dll` using `GetProcAddress`
8. Display the message "PEB walk success" using `MessageBoxA`

Code:
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <windows.h>

int main() {
    PEB* peb;
    PLDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY module;
    LIST_ENTRY* listEntry;
    HMODULE kernel32baseAddr = NULL;
    GETPROCADDRESS ptrGetProcAddress = NULL;
    LOADLIBRARYA ptrLoadLibraryA = NULL;
    MESSAGEBOXA ptrMessageBoxA = NULL;

    __asm {
        mov eax, fs: [0x30]
        mov peb, eax
    }

    // Traverse the InLoadOrderModuleList to find kernel32.dll
    listEntry = peb->Ldr->InLoadOrderModuleList.Flink;
    do {
        module = CONTAINING_RECORD(listEntry, LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY, InLoadOrderLinks);

        char baseDllName[256];
        int i;
        for (i = 0; i < module->BaseDllName.Length / sizeof(WCHAR) && i < sizeof(baseDllName) - 1; i++) {
            baseDllName[i] = (char)module->BaseDllName.Buffer[i];
        }
        baseDllName[i] = '\0';

        if (_stricmp(baseDllName, "kernel32.dll") == 0) {
            kernel32baseAddr = (HMODULE)module->DllBase;
        }

        listEntry = listEntry->Flink;
    } while (listEntry != &peb->Ldr->InLoadOrderModuleList);

    if (kernel32baseAddr) {
        ptrGetProcAddress = (GETPROCADDRESS)GetProcAddress(kernel32baseAddr, "GetProcAddress");
        ptrLoadLibraryA = (LOADLIBRARYA)GetProcAddress(kernel32baseAddr, "LoadLibraryA");
        HMODULE user32Base = ptrLoadLibraryA("user32.dll");
        ptrMessageBoxA = (MESSAGEBOXA)ptrGetProcAddress(user32Base, "MessageBoxA");
        ptrMessageBoxA(NULL, "PEB walk success", "Success", MB_OK);
        }
    return 0;
}
```

And here is the decompiled code after we rename several variables and apply `_LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY` structure:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5afefc9d-fd43-4346-b19f-d32c63ec519d)

Now we can see that the code is resolving important API functions during runtime by performing the PEB walk method to locate the target DLL (`kernel32.dll`) and then extracting the addresses of essential API functions. This technique allows the code to dynamically locate and use functions like `LoadLibraryA`, `GetProcAddress`, and `MessageBoxA` without relying on static linking, which can slow-down the reverse engineering process.

# Sum up
Understanding the PEB walk technique is important for malware analysis as it is commonly used in modern malware to dynamically resolve API functions. By walking through the PEB, malware can locate important DLLs such as `kernel32.dll` and `user32.dll`, and extract the addresses of functions. This method helps malware avoid straightforward inspection of API calls in the Import Address Table (IAT), making it more difficult for analysts to identify and understand the malware's behavior.

We're going to continue this blog in the second part of the series, talking about API hashing! See you.
