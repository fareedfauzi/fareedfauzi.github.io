I have compiled a series of GitBook notes encompassing various aspects of cybersecurity, including knowledge, tips, and content. These notes delve into topics such as forensics, Capture The Flag (CTF), certification tips, and much more. Here is a list of included resources: 

1. https://fareedfauzi.gitbook.io/windows-forensics-playbook/ - Windows Forensics Playbook
2. https://fareedfauzi.gitbook.io/oscp-playbook/ - OSCP Playbook and Cheat Sheet
3. https://fareedfauzi.gitbook.io/ctf-playbook/ - CTF beginner Playbook and Cheat Sheet

Additionally, I plan to expand the content to cover other critical topics like red teaming, malware development (maldev), reverse engineering, malware analysis, incident response (IR), threat hunting, penetration testing, and many more. Your support on Buy [https://www.buymeacoffee.com/fareedfauzi](Me A Coffee) would greatly aid me in creating more content like this.
