Hi, good day everyone. Just another so called "security guy" hosting cyber security related blog. He working at a local cyber security company doing digital forensics, malware analysis, malware research and reverse engineering stuff.

His interested mainly in reverse code engineering and analysis, malware research and development, CTF, digital forensics, threat intelligence and works on them for fun, research, and work.

The aim of this personal blog is for research, education and note purpose focusly on malware analysis and reverse code engineering. Anything posted in his blog is his own stuff and is not affiliated with any company that he's working for.

I have compiled a series of GitBook notes encompassing various aspects of cybersecurity, including knowledge, tips, and content. These notes delve into topics such as forensics, Capture The Flag (CTF), certification tips, and much more. Here is a list of included resources: 

1. https://fareedfauzi.gitbook.io/windows-forensics-playbook/ - Windows Forensics Playbook
2. https://fareedfauzi.gitbook.io/oscp-playbook/ - OSCP Playbook and Cheat Sheet
3. https://fareedfauzi.gitbook.io/ctf-playbook/ - CTF beginner Playbook and Cheat Sheet

Additionally, I plan to expand the content to cover other critical topics like red teaming, malware development (maldev), reverse engineering, malware analysis, incident response (IR), threat hunting, penetration testing, and many more. Your support on Buy [https://www.buymeacoffee.com/fareedfauzi](Me A Coffee) would greatly aid me in creating more content like this.
